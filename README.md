# MailMergeFileParser
## Description
This project is a WinForms application developed for a client to automate the process of merging data from an Excel file into a Word document template using merge fields. The application requires the user to provide an input Excel file and a template file in Word format. The merge fields in the Word template should match the headers in the Excel file for successful mapping of values. The merged output is then generated and saved to the specified location.

## Features
**Data Merge**: The application facilitates merging data from an Excel file into a Word document template using merge fields.  
**User Input**: The user is prompted to provide the input Excel file and the Word template file.  
**Merge Field Mapping**: The merge fields in the Word template should correspond to the headers in the Excel file for proper mapping of values.  
**Output Generation**: The merged output is generated by replacing the merge fields with the corresponding data from the Excel file.  
**Output Location**: The user can specify the location where the merged output should be saved.
